The SmartPay_mRDC SDK is designed for businesses to deposit checks using camera-enabled smartphones and tablets. It embeds comprehensive [JH SmartPay Mobile Deposit Complete]( https://api.payments.jackhenry.com/docs/mob-rdc/overview/) (mRDC) check-deposit functionality into a native mobile application and includes a prebuilt network layer for easily consuming the API. 

This SDK allows businesses to incorporate check deposit capabilities into their mobile applications with minimal technical development effort, significantly reducing development time and accelerating the adoption of the API.  

## Key Features

- **Multi-Item Batches**: Bundle multiple check items into one batch for a single deposit.
- **Deposit History**: View previous deposit activity with item and status details.
- **Image Display**: Access front and back images of checks along with deposit history.
- **Data Entry** *(**optional**)*: Enter additional transaction information for reporting purposes.
- **Custom Batch ID** *(**optional**)*: Add custom descriptions to batches for reporting.
